.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-lookup\fR \- Data in modules lookup function
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
The lookup command is used for debugging and testing a given data configuration\. For a given data key, lookup will produce either a value or an explanation of how that value was obtained on the standard output stream with the specified rendering format\. Lookup is designed to be run on a puppet master or a node in a masterless setup\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
puppet lookup [\-\-help] [\-\-type \fITYPESTRING\fR] [\-\-merge unique|hash|deep] [\-\-knock\-out\-prefix \fIPREFIX\-STRING\fR] [\-\-sort\-merged\-arrays] [\-\-merge\-hash\-arrays] [\-\-explain] [\-\-default \fIVALUE\fR] [\-\-node \fINODE\-NAME\fR] [\-\-facts \fIFILE\fR] [\-\-compile] [\-\-render\-as s|json|yaml|binary|msgpack] \fIkeys\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The lookup command is a CLI interface for the puppet lookup function\. When given one or more keys, the lookup command will return the first value found when run from the puppet master or a masterless node\.
.
.P
When an explanation has not been requested and lookup is simply looking up a value, the application will exit with 0 if a value was found and 1 otherwise\. When an explanation is requested, lookup will always exit with 0 unless there is a major error\.
.
.P
The other options are as passed into the lookup function, and the effect they have on the lookup is described in more detail in the header for the lookup function:

.SH "OPTIONS"
These options and their effects are described in more detail in the puppet lookup function linked to above\.

.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-help: Print this help message\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-type \fITYPESTRING\fR: Assert that the value has the specified type\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-merge unique|hash|deep: Specify the merge strategy\. \'hash\' performs a simple hash\-merge by overwriting keys of lower lookup priority\. \'unique\' appends everything to an array containing no nested arrays and where all duplicates have been removed\. \'deep\' Performs a deep merge on values of Array and Hash type\. There are additional option flags that can be used with \'deep\'\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-knock\-out\-prefix \fIPREFIX\-STRING\fR Can be used with the \'deep\' merge strategy\. Specify string value to signify prefix which deletes elements from existing element\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-sort\-merged\-arrays Can be used with the \'deep\' merge strategy\. When this flag is used all merged arrays will be sorted\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-merge\-hash\-arrays Can be used with the \'deep\' merge strategy\. When this flag is used arrays and hashes will be merged\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-explain Print an explanation for the details of how the lookup performed rather than the value returned for the key\. The explanation will describe how the result was obtained or why lookup failed to obtain the result\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-explain\-options Explain if a lookup_options hash will be used and how it was assembled when performing a lookup\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-default \fIVALUE\fR A value produced if no value was found in the lookup\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-node \fINODE\-NAME\fR Specify node which defines the scope in which the lookup will be performed\. If a node is not given, lookup will default to the machine from which the lookup is being run (which should be the master)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-facts \fIFILE\fR Specify a \.json, or \.yaml file holding key => value mappings that will override the facts for the current node\. Any facts not specified by the user will maintain their original value\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-compile Perform a full catalog compilation prior to the lookup\. This is meaningful when the catalog changes global variables that are referenced in interpolated values\. No catalog compilation takes place unless this flag is given\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\-\-render\-as s|json|yaml|binary|msgpack Determines how the results will be rendered to the standard output where s means plain text\. The default when lookup is producing a value is yaml and the default when producing an explanation is s\.

.SH "EXAMPLE"
If you wanted to lookup \'key_name\' within the scope of the master, you would call lookup like this: $ puppet lookup key_name
.
.P
If you wanted to lookup \'key_name\' within the scope of the agent\.local node, you would call lookup like this: $ puppet lookup \-\-node agent\.local key_name
.
.P
If you wanted to get the first value found for \'key_name_one\' and \'key_name_two\' within the scope of the agent\.local node while merging values and knocking out the prefix \'foo\' while merging, you would call lookup like this: $ puppet lookup \-\-node agent\.local \-\-merge deep \-\-knock\-out\-prefix foo key_name_one key_name_two
.
.P
If you wanted to lookup \'key_name\' within the scope of the agent\.local node, and return a default value of \'bar\' if nothing was found, you would call lookup like this: $ puppet lookup \-\-node agent\.local \-\-default bar key_name
.
.P
If you wanted to see an explanation of how the value for \'key_name\' would be obtained in the context of the agent\.local node, you would call lookup like this: $ puppet lookup \-\-node agent\.local \-\-explain key_name
